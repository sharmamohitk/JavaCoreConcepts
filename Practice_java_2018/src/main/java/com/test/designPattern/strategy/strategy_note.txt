1. Strategy design pattern define family of algorithm, encapsulate each one and makes them interchangeable.
2. Inheritance hierarchy works well in top to downwards i.e. if we need the inherit parent behaviour/properties 
3. if we need to share the functionality among classes then we need to use composition and it's a good design approach.
4. it remove duplicate code and doesn't force us to write unnecessary code.
